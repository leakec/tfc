All of the examples conatined within this directory are from [Carl Leake's PhD dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351591316_The_Multivariate_Theory_of_Functional_Connections_An_n-Dimensional_Constraint_Embedding_Technique_Applied_to_Partial_Differential_Equations). The folders and files are named so that they correspond with the appropriate example in the dissertation. For example, on page 35 of the dissertation you will find Example 2.6, which creates a constrained expression for a given set of constraints and plots the constrained expressison for a particular free function. The code used to create that plot can be found in [Chapter_2/Example_2_6.py](https://github.com/leakec/tfc/blob/main/examples/Carl_Leake_Dissertation/Chapter_2/Example_2_6.py). Therefore, if you are interested in a particular piece of code you can read more about it in the dissertation, or if you like a particular example in the dissertation (and it has associated code) then you can explore its implementation here.

In addition, a video of [Carl's defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uisOZVBHA2U) is available that showcases some of the aforementioned examples.
