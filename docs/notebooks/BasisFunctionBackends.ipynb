    "The TFC module comes equipped with C++ and Python versions of the basis function backends. For the `utfc` and `mtfc` modules, the basis function backend can be changed using the `backend` keyword. The pros and cons of each backend are summarized in the table below:\n",

    "| Feature | C++ backend | Python backend |\n",

    "| Number types suppported | Doubles only | Supports any number type that numpy supports: float, complex, etc. |\n",
    "| Derivative order supported | Arbitrary order dervatives for most basis functions, but only up to 8th order derivatives for some. | Arbitary order derivatives for all basis functions. |\n",
    "| Compiling with JIT | Can be compiled with native JAX JIT. Optimization function can optimize on the variables used to compute the basis functions. | Can only be compiled with `pejit`, and basis function must be able to be cached before compiling, i.e., inputs to the basis functions can not be optimized, but must be constant with resect the optimization problem. This is true for differential equations solved via TFC, but is not true for all optimziation problems. See the [pejit tutorial](pejit.ipynb) for more details. |\n",

    "For the vast majority of applications, the `C++` backend is sufficient. Plus, it is easier for a newer user to use the regular JAX `jit` transform than `pejit`, so `C++` is the default backend. However, for more advanced applications, e.g., solving complex differential equations, a more robust version of the basis functions are needed, which is why the Python backend exists."
